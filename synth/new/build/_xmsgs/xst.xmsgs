<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="3152" delta="new" >You have chosen to run a version of XST which is not the default solution
for the specified device family. You are free to use it in order to take
advantage of its enhanced HDL parsing/elaboration capabilities. However,
please be aware that you may be impacted by  language support differences.
This version may also result in circuit performance and device utilization
differences for your particular design. You can always revert back to the
default XST solution by setting the &quot;use_new_parser&quot; option to value &quot;no&quot; 
on the XST command line or in the XST process properties panel.
